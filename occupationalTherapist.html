        <h2>In an acute setting</h2>

        <p class="fullDesc">Noticing the differences between Occupational and Physical Therapists in acute care can be tricky, especially
            for patients
            that may be feeling unwell. It's important to understand their differences so that you as the patient can
            better focus on progressing in the direction of the goals that the different therapists are helping you achieve.
